// LeepYearCalculator.cpp : This file contains the 'main' function. Program execution begins and ends there.

//Optional: Let’s try a challenging problem that will put all your brain cells to the test.

//Write a leap_year.cpp program that :

//Takes a year as input.
//Checks to see if the year is a four - digit number.
//Displays whether or not the year falls on a leap year.

//There are 3 criteria that must be taken into account to identify a leap year :

    //If the year can be evenly divided by 4 then it is a leap year, however…
    //If that year can be evenly divided by 100, and it is not evenly divided by 400, then it is NOT a leap year.
    //If that year is evenly divisible by 400, then it is a leap year.
//Take some time to researchand brainstorm before starting to write the code!

#include <iostream>

int main()
{

    //set a year variable
    //get input to see what year it is cin

    //check to see if it is a 4 digit number - research how .size?

    //calculate if the year is a leap year - research how to do this

    //display if this year is a leap year



    std::cout << "Hello World!\n";
}
